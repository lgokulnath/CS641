# CS641 Modern Cryptology Assignments 
Done in a team with [Hitesh Anand](https://github.com/hitesh-anand) and [Harsh Trivedi](https://github.com/harsh500)

Assignments involved solving a game hosted in a server. The following are the cryptographic systems we decrypted in the assignments:
- Assignment 1: Substitution Cipher
- Assignment 2: Vignere Cipher
- Assignment 3: Substitution Permutation Network
- Assignment 4: DES 6 rounds
- Assignment 5: Simplified AES

We used C++, Python and Bash for writing the codes for the assignments.
